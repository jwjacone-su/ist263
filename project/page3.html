            <h2>NFC Wildcard Round: at Seattle Seahawks</h2>
            <p>
                The Rams, the 6-seed in the NFC playoff bracket, would travel to Seattle to play the 3-seed Seahawks for the third time this season, twice in Seattle. Ahead of the game, the biggest storyline was what the Rams were going to do at QB, as Jared Goff was still rehabbing his thumb injury but was cleared to play, however many believed John Wolford deserved to start ahead of Goff because of his performance a week before. Ultimately it wouldn’t end up mattering, as Sean McVay went with Wolford for the start only to have him knocked out of the game by Seahawks safety Jamal Adams on the second possession. McVay’s decision to start Wolford made it clear that he was growing impatient with Jared Goff, which led to his eventual departure from the Rams during the offseason. Goff did what he had to do, however, coming out to a rocky start but avoiding turnovers throughout. RB Cam Akers had another monster game, racking up 176 total yards and a touchdown, the third most by any Rams postseason rusher in team history. The Rams were able to jump out to a 13-3 lead, largely thanks to a spectacular Darious Williams interception on a screen pass which he returned 42-yards for a touchdown. Seahawks WR DK Metcalf would end up scoring a TD on the next possession on a broken play, however the Rams quickly responded after a stellar drive by Cam Akers that resulted in a 5-yard TD run and a 20-10 Rams lead at halftime. In the second half, a Matt Gay field goal followed by a wide-open Robert Woods touchdown reception gave the Rams a commanding 30-13 lead, essentially ending the game. The defense stepped up once again, harassing Russell Wilson for 5 sacks. Aaron Donald and Leonard Floyd each had 2 sacks. In a game that many believed would be an easy win for the favored 3-seeded Seahawks, the Rams dominated in every facet and ended their division rival’s season. The game ended 30-20, and the Rams advanced to the NFC Divisional Round to play the 1-seed Green Bay Packers.

            <h2>NFC Divisional Round: at Green Bay Packers</h2>
            <p>
                After a spectacular performance the week before, the Rams would not have much time to celebrate ahead of a divisional playoff matchup against the 1-seed Green Bay Packers, led by league MVP Aaron Rodgers. Ultimately it looked as though the Rams had met their match, as Rodgers consistently tore through the Rams’ vaunted defense, piling up a season high 484 yards against them. Goff played as well as he could, going 21 for 27 for 174 yards and a touchdown to rookie WR Van Jefferson in the 2nd quarter to make the score 16-10 Packers. This would be the closest the Rams would get to a lead, as the Packers put together scoring drive after scoring drive playing excellent football. A 7-yard Cam Akers wildcat rush for a touchdown made the score 18-25 in the third quarter, however Aaron Rodgers would go on to seal the win with a deep touchdown pass in the 4th. The Rams season would end to the Packers 32-18 in the divisional round of the playoffs, capping off a season that many NFL experts and fans considered to exceed preseason expectations.
