            <h2>Week 10: vs. Seattle Seahawks</h2>
            </div>
            <p>
                In a classic NFC west battle, the Seattle Seahawks traveled to LA for a key matchup for the NFC West standings. Once again, the Rams defense came out hungry, absolutely harassing Seahawks’ QB Russell Wilson. The defense gathered six sacks and two interceptions, both interceptions courtesy of CB Darious Williams who had begun to gain attention around the league for his ball-hawking skills. Rams LB Leonard Floyd had another monster game, with 3 sacks and a fumble recovery which led him to win NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors. Perhaps the most impactful performance however came from CB Jalen Ramsey, who completely clamped up Seahawks’ star WR DK Metcalf, not allowing a single reception while he was manned up on Metcalf. The Rams led by a score of 17-7 at halftime after two rushing touchdowns and a field goal, and that would prove to be all they needed as the Rams defense continued to make their case as the top defense in the NFL. This game came with a price however, as All-Pro LT Andrew Whitworth suffered a torn MCL which many people thought would not only end his season, but possibly his career. At the end of the day, the Rams won 23-16 in a sweet victory for Rams fans, improving to 6-3 on the season and 5-1 against the Seahawks in the last 6 matchups between these two teams.

            </div>
            <p>
                In yet another primetime matchup, the Rams traveled to Tampa Bay to play Tom Brady’s Buccaneers, the QB who had previously beaten the Rams twice in the super bowl. The 7-3 Bucs were favored to win at home, however the Rams had something to say about this. The Rams’ passing offense was methodical, with Rams QB Jared Goff going 39/51 for 376 yards and three touchdowns. The Rams’ receiving duo of Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp destroyed the Buccaneers secondary, and Rams’ rookie WR Van Jefferson recorded his first NFL touchdown on a 7-yard slant in the 2nd quarter. Rams rookie RB Cam Akers caught a touchdown pass as well. The game was neck and neck throughout, however newly acquired kicker Matt Gay made what would be the game winning field goal with 2:40 remaining in the game (a welcoming sight after a slew of terrible kicking performances by Sloman and Forbath). Tom Brady and the Buccaneers offense was given a chance to tie/win with over 2 minutes left in the game, however an errant deep ball by Brady would end up being intercepted by Rams’ stud rookie safety Jordan Fuller to seal the game for the Rams, his second interception of Brady on the night. Rams fans rejoiced following this one, having finally beaten Tom Brady and winning a tight game against the eventual super bowl winners on the road on national TV. The Rams improved to 7-3 on the season, and 1st place in the NFC West after a game that led many people to believe that the Rams could be legitimate super bowl contenders.

            </div>
            <p>
                Once again, the Rams’ struggled mightily against the injury riddled 49ers, in a loss that led many Rams fans to wonder about the teams’ inability to play well against the niners. The 49ers forced 4 Rams turnovers, 3 coming from QB Jared Goff, as Goff continued his turnover-filled season. The Rams fell to a 17-3 deficit, however a stellar play by DT Aaron Donald resulted in a fumble recovered by CB Troy Hill for a touchdown, putting the Rams back into the game. After a 49ers punt, Rams fans enjoyed possibly the only positive outcome of the game, as Rams rookie RB Cam Akers exploded onto the scene with a 61-yard run, and eventually scored his first career touchdown run a few plays later, giving the Rams a 20-17 lead at the beginning of the 4th. However, the Rams defense couldn’t continue to hold the 49ers, as San Francisco ended up scoring field goals on their final two possessions, one of those field goals being the game winner as time expired. The Rams lost 23-20 and dropped to 7-4 on the season after a game that confused many football fans across the nation, especially after the Rams’ stellar performance a week before. The 49ers had now beaten the Rams four straight times.

            </div>
            <p>
                For the first time this season, the Rams played division rival Arizona Cardinals for a key NFC West matchup. The Rams continued their dominance over the Cardinals, dropping 38 points in a game that was relatively close until a 21-point 4th quarter by the Rams. QB Jared Goff played well, going 37 for 47 with 351 and a TD. Rookie RB Cam Akers continued his stretch of production, rushing for 72 yards and a TD and adding 22 receiving yards. The key plays happened in the 4th, as RB Darrell Henderson broke free for a 38-yard score in addition to a Troy Hill interception for a touchdown to give the Rams a sizeable 38-21 lead. The Rams defense did their job for the most part, holding QB Kyler Murray to only 15 yards rushing. Rams CB Jalen Ramsey continued his case for best CB in the league, as he held All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins to very limited production. The Rams won 38-28 and improved to 8-4 on the season, and with a Seahawks loss regained 1st place in the NFC West. The Rams had now beaten the Cardinals 7 times in a row, with Sean McVay having never lost to his division opponent.

            <p>
                Week 14 saw the Rams travel to Foxborough to play Bill Belichick’s Patriots, the team that had beaten the Rams twice in the super bowl. This time, it was the Patriots who only put up 3 points as the Rams’ defense absolutely stifled Cam Newton’s offense, making the QB look dazed and confused throughout the duration of the matchup and eventually benched in favor of Jarrett Stidham after a 9/16, 119-yard performance. On one of the only promising Patriots’ drives, Newton threw an errant screen pass that got intercepted by Rams LB Kenny Young which he returned 79 yards for a touchdown on one of the most exciting plays of the Rams’ season. The offense dominated from the opening drive thanks to remarkable play by rookie RB Cam Akers. Akers had his true breakout performance, gaining 171 yards on 29 carries on the ground, including a handful of explosive 20+ yard runs. Cam Akers’ performance was the most yards gained by a rookie RB all season at the time, and was the most yards ever gained by a rookie RB versus the Patriots. The Rams would end up dominating the Patriots 24-3, beating the Patriots for the first time since 2001. The Rams improved to 9-4, clinching a winning season and maintaining 1st place in the NFC West.

            </div>
            <p>
                After having lost the previous week to the Jets, the Rams now needed to travel to Seattle in a matchup that could clinch the NFC West for Seattle with a Rams loss. The Rams’ offense was abysmal, as QB Jared Goff continued to struggle with ball security with 2 turnovers, including an interception on the Seahawks’ side of the field on one of the worst throws I’ve ever seen. Goff would end up breaking his thumb on his throwing hand midway through the game, which he popped back into place and continued to play. With this said, the game was relatively close until the end thanks to the Rams’ defense playing spectacularly. With the score at 13-6 Seahawks in the 3rd quarter, the Rams would end up driving all the way to the 1-yard line only to be stopped on consecutive runs and turn the ball over on downs after a failed 4th down conversion. The only Rams points came via kicker Matt Gay, who hit 3 field goals and continued to establish himself as the obvious choice for the kicker job. In the end, the Seahawks prevailed after two second half touchdowns, winning the game 20-9 and clinching the NFC West. The Rams fell to 9-5 on the season. The Rams had only needed to win one more game to clinch the playoffs, but after consecutive losses and a now-injured Jared Goff and Cam Akers, many Rams fans watched as their season was falling apart at the seams, and many were worried that the Rams would not make the playoffs despite such a hot start to the season.

            <p>
                Going into week 17, the Rams faced a simple scenario: win and you’re in the playoffs. The problem was, Rams QB Jared Goff was ruled out of the game due to the thumb injury he suffered the week before against the Seahawks, and backup QB John Wolford, who had never taken an NFL snap, was named starter for a game with massive playoff implications. Many thought Wolford would struggle under the pressure, and this proved to be accurate to a degree when Wolford’s first NFL pass was intercepted for a touchdown, giving the Cardinals a 7-0 lead early in the game. However, Wolford responded to this early adversity tremendously, and went on to guide the Rams’ offense on multiple key drives. Wolford surprised the Cardinals offense with his speed, rushing 6 times for 56 yards including multiple crucial 3rd down conversions, one coming late in the 4th quarter to seal the Rams’ win. Cardinals QB Kyler Murray was knocked out of the game early and replaced with QB Chris Streveler, who struggled mightily. The Rams defense only allowed 7 points, and a Troy Hill interception for a touchdown with only 20 seconds left before halftime ended up being the true difference maker in the game, and the only Rams touchdown. The Rams’ defense also was awarded a safety after a holding penalty was called in the endzone against Arizona. The Rams’ defense would finish the regular season #1 in terms of yards allowed after another dominant performance. The Rams would finish out the regular season with a 18-7 win, improving to 10-6 for the season and making the playoffs as a 6 seed. John Wolford was firmly established as a Rams fan favorite after his gutsy performance to launch the Rams into the playoffs.
