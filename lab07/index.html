<h1>Joe Jaconetta's Biography</h1>

    <p>
    My name is Joseph Jaconetta. I’ve grown up in Glastonbury, Connecticut all my life and go to college at Syracuse University where I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my undergraduate career thus far. I study Information Management & Technology (Data Analytics and Web Design) along with a minor in Sport Management because I’ve always been highly passionate about both tech and sports, and I’m interested in pursuing a career that combines data/tech with the sports world.
    At Syracuse, I serve as a Peer Advisor for the university’s school of information studies, which involves serving as a role model to my peers and leading school events and recruiting. Back in Glastonbury, I worked at a meat counter for a small family-owned supermarket for about three years. I graduated from Glastonbury High School as a high honors student, and I’m currently working towards achieving the same success in college.

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

    <p>
    I’m the youngest of three siblings, an older brother who’s 29 and an older sister who’s 27. My favorite hobbies include sports and music. My family and I are huge <strong>Los Angeles Rams</strong> fans, even though we grew up in the North-east. I’m personally also a Los Angeles Lakers fan, as I grew up idolizing the late Kobe Bryant. I played football and basketball for my school growing up, and still love playing pickup games with friends to this day. I also play guitar occasionally, and enjoy learning to cook new things.
